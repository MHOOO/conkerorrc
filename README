These are my conkeror configuration file.
(Conkeror is a mozilla based, keyboard oriented and highly programmable web browser.)
There are some dirty but featured hacks here, as well as things that I shamelessly copied from others.

bookmark-manipulate.js :
A command to remove a specified bookmark is available.  So you don't have to use something like sqlite to do so.

history-manipulate.js :
A command to clear history is available.  No more sqlite.

flashblock.js :
A helper to enable under conkeror the famous flashblock add-on for firefox.  Linux users may want it because flashes often hurt your CPU.  Click (or `f') to play flashes when you really really need them.

invisible-scrollbar.js :
The trick is to fix the isearch scrolling problem when scroll bar is not visible.

scroll-percentage.js :
Scrolling by a whole page sometimes is just too much.  What about an arbitrary percentage?

undo-kill-buffer.js :
A simple way to remember and re-open killed buffers.  Only the URLs are stored, things like buffer history, position are lost.  Note: the meaning of buffer_kill_before_hook is disputed and actually is altered here.

browser-relationship.js :
Add support for some Chinese version of next/previous links.

zoom-width.js :
Zoom pages without changing text size.  This deals with pages that do not fit my slim horizontal resolution.
